## How can I make this?
Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/MakayaYoel/Procedural-Map-Generator/wiki/Tutorial) to learn how to make this.

There are also videos that teach how to make something like this. I enjoyed learning how to make this from [White Box Dev's](https://youtu.be/slTEz6555Ts?si=7ra4MYzphw1DvV6d) and [Sebastian Lague's](https://youtu.be/v7yyZZjF1z4?si=ixkQ0VCxOtyW7cRQ).

## Installation
Simply head over to the releases, download the `.zip` file, extract it, and run the `.exe` file.
